### Day 2: 2020, November 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Work on CSS drawing boiler plate file, making it fully responsive and documenting the code. Was a mainly CSS and flexbox.
2. Removed the .gitignore and documented why in the file, left the file but renamed it .gitignore_default with instructions.

**Thoughts**: Not quite ready to push the boiler plate public but will do once I feel others could understand it and maybe find it useful, no rush really.

### Day 1: 2020, November 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Forked this 100 Days of Code Repository and cloned it to Desktop. Changed this log.md file and change its content. 
2. Add the .gitignore to repo as not included. /.idea/ needed to be ignored.
3. Tidied up my CSS drawing boiler plate file.

**Thoughts** Using PHP storm to edit this file was really helpful. I have not really written a lot of Readme text files, so it a good habit to start.
