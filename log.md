### Day 9: 2020 November 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:

1. Worked on 3D space in CSS. Mainly grouping of elements to make objects re-usable. Plus animation of the 3D space.

### Day 8: 2020 November 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:

1. CSS/  translate-origin transform: rotateY translate.
2. Made some items with triangles made with clip-path: polygon().

 translate in the transform rule.

### Day 7: 2020 November 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

1. CSS transform: rotateY translate.
2. Made a step by step "cheat-sheet", not quite finished.

### Day 6: 2020 November 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:

1. CSS transform: rotateY translate.
2. Made a cube just by thinking about it, step by step. Added some helper 3D planes.

**Thoughts:** Element in CSS are doubled sided, I guess the same a 3D software default. As you rotate elements the axis/planes are rotated with it. So translate remains perpendicular to the plane.

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Work on CSS drawing boiler plate file, making it fully responsive and documenting the code. Was a mainly CSS and flexbox.
2. Removed the .gitignore and documented why in the file, left the file but renamed it .gitignore_default with instructions.

**Thoughts**: Not quite ready to push the boiler plate public but will do once I feel others could understand it and maybe find it useful, no rush really.

### Day 1: 2020, November 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Forked this 100 Days of Code Repository and cloned it to Desktop. Changed this log.md file and change its content. 
2. Add the .gitignore to repo as not included. /.idea/ needed to be ignored.
3. Tidied up my CSS drawing boiler plate file.

**Thoughts** Using PHP storm to edit this file was really helpful. I have not really written a lot of Readme text files, so it a good habit to start.
