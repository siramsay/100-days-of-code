# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: 2020 November 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: ~~Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.~~

**Thoughts:** ~~I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.~~

### Day 1: 2020, November 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Forked this 100 Days of Code Repository and cloned it to Desktop. Changed this log.md file and change its content. 
2. Tidied up my CSS drawing boiler plate file.

**Thoughts** Using PHP storm to edit this file was really helpful. I have not really written a lot of Readme text files, so it a good habit to start.
