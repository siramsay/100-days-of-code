1. CSS/  translate-origin transform: rotateY translate.
2. Made some items with triangles made with clip-path: polygon().

 translate in the transform rule.

### Day 7: 2020 November 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

1. CSS transform: rotateY translate.

### Day 6: 2020 November 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:

1. CSS transform: rotateY translate.
2. Made a cube just by thinking about it, step by step. Added some helper 3D planes.

**Thoughts:** Element in CSS are doubled sided, I guess the same a 3D software default. As you rotate elements the axis/planes are rotated with it. So translate remains perpendicular to the plane.

1. Work on CSS drawing boiler plate file, making it fully responsive and documenting the code. Was a mainly CSS and flexbox.

### Day 1: 2020, November 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:
