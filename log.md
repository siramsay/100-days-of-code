# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: 2020 November 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: ~~Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.~~

**Thoughts:** ~~I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.~~

**Link to work:** ~~[My Public Link](http://www.example.com)~~

### Day 2: 2020, November 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Work on CSS drawing boiler plate file, making it fully responsive nad documenting the code. Was a mainly CSS and flexbox.
2. Removed the .gitignore and documented why in the file, left the file but renamed it .gitignore_default with instructions.

**Thoughts**: Not quite ready to push the boiler plate public but will do once I feel others could understand it and maybe find it useful, no rush really.

**Link(s) to work**: ~~[.gitignore_default](https://github.com/siramsay/100-days-of-code/blob/master/.gitignore_default)


### Day 1: 2020, November 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Forked this 100 Days of Code Repository and cloned it to Desktop. Changed this log.md file and change its content. 
2. Add the .gitignore to repo as not included. /.idea/ needed to be ignored.
3. Tidied up my CSS drawing boiler plate file.

**Thoughts** Using PHP storm to edit this file was really helpful. I have not really written a lot of Readme text files, so it a good habit to start.
